# Play Werewolf with AI
An online game based on the famous werewolf cardgame, but also with AI-agents as players. 

It is a case study how well AI-agents (using LLMs) act in human collaboration.
* Are AI agents on a par with humans when it comes to communication and collaboration? 
* Is it fun to play a board game with AI players?
* If not, what improvements could be made to bring AI agents closer to humans, and what could a technical implementation look like?

These questions will be examined and answered in the context of an online board game - the card game "Werewolves".
