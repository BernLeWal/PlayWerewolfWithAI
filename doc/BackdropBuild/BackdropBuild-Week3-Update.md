## Week 3 - Report

### What are you launching in Week 4?
Write one paragraph like a press release, explaining what you're going to launch in Week 4 and why this launch is cool for your ideal users and early testers.

```
This week the updated prototype of the game is launched as GIT repository. The Moderator-Bots automatically guides the players through the game and multiple AI-Players within one game are supported.
```

### What are the steps still missing between now and your launch?
Summarize in bullets what you need to do to launch that thing you are planning to launch.

```
* Concurrency issues in the python program. (Discord.py needs async tasks, OpenAI call blocks the tasks)
* Make the AI-Agents vote for someone (Currently the LLM is chatty, discusses around, but does not decide for a player in the votings - without that, the game can't go on)
```

### Are you on track to launch by Launch Day (November 29th)?

```
I don't think so
```

### What have you shipped this week?
Tell everyone what you have shipped this week, no matter how big or small. What matters is to keep on shipping!
