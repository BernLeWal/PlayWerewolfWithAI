# PlayWerewolfWithAI - Intro Video Draft

## 1. The Concept

- Have you ever pondered the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social interactions and collaboration with humans, beyond just reproducing facts?
- How effectively can AI agents collaborate with human players, both as teammates and adversaries?
- Are AI agents capable of deceiving human players to secure a win independently?
- What is the experience like playing alongside or against AI agents?

###

- Intrigued by these questions, I embarked on a journey to explore them using the well-known card game "Werewolves of Millers Hollow".
- Sparked by this idea, I joined the Backdrop Build v2 challenge. After three intense weeks of coding during my off-hours, I am excited to unveil the first prototype.

## 2. Product Introduction

- PlayWerewolfWithAI is a Discord application hosted on the server "wAIrewolves".
- It brings to life the popular social role-playing game where players are divided into villagers and werewolves, each group striving to outwit the other.
- Detailed game rules can be found at the provided link.
- The game features a ModeratorBot, acting as the narrator and overseer of the gameplay.
- Additionally, an AIAgentPlayer bot represents one or more AI players in the game.
- Let's dive into the online gaming experience.

## 3. Hands-On Demo

- I've set up three human players for this demonstration: Tron, Alan, and Kevin_Flynn.
- We initiate a game in the "game1" channel.
- The !help command reveals interactions available with the ModeratorBot.
- !status provides a recap of the ongoing game scenario.
- Let's add our human users to the mix.
- To incorporate AI Agents, we use a specific command, allowing even name customization for these AI players.
- Observe how the AI Agents interact and respond in real-time.
- “Hi Rea, delighted to have you. Let's get the game started.”
- The game begins with the ModeratorBot shuffling and distributing roles among players.

## 4. Highlighting Collaborative Moments
- I already played a few rounds, so lets fast forward and have a look at some of the remarkable interactions between AIAgents and human players.
- (Locate and display text instances with the word "suspicious" to showcase notable player collaborations.)

## 5. Conclusion
- That concludes our brief introductory video.
- I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the BackdropBuild team for inspiring me to transform a mere concept into a tangible prototype.
- What an exhilarating journey this has been!
- Thank you for watching.
