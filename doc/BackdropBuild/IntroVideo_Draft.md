# PlayWerewolfWithAI - Intro-Video Draft

## 1. The idea

- Did you ever wonder how good LLMs are in terms of social interaction, collaborations with human beings - besides the common LLM use of reproducing of facts?
- How well would AI-agents collaborate with humans together and against opposite teams? 
- Cheat and lie to human players in order to win a game by itself?
- Does it make fun to play together and/or against AI-Agents?

###
- I did wonder - so I've born the idea to try this out using a famous card game - "Werewolves from Düsterwald".
- Only with that idea at start I took part in backdrop build v2 - and now, after three weeks and a lot of night coding sessions beside my day work I proudly present the first prototype for you.

## 2. Product intro

- PlayWerewolfWithAI is a discord application running on my discord guild "wAIrewolves".
- It is the implementation of the famous social role-playing game that divides a group of people into two camps: the villagers and the werewolves, who have to win together against the other team.
- You'll find the explanation of the game rules in the provided link.
- There is one ModeratorBot who is the story teller and controls the gameplay.
- And there is a AIAgentPlayer bot who will represent one or more instances of AI-players within that game.
- So now let's have a look into the game online

## 3. Hands-On Demo
- I've prepared three human players here: Tron, Alan and Kevin_Flynn
- To start a game we create a channel where the game will take place, I'll use "game1"
- The !help command shows how you can interact with the ModeratorBot
- !status recaps the current situation in the game
- Now let's join our human users to play
- We also want to have AI-Agents as players, these are invited with the command, where I also may give the AI-Agent a name
- Now you see, that the AI-Agents already responds and you may interact with them
- "Hi Rea, I'm happy to have you here, let's start the game"
- Now we start the game …. And the ModeratorBot will shuffle the cards - our roles - and distribute them to us.

## 4. Show some remarkable collaborations

- (Search for word "suspicious" and show some of the collaboration Texts.)
 
## 5. Finale

- Ok folks, that's it for now - for this short introductional video.
- Finally, I would like to thank the BackdropBuild team for sparking the energy in me to build a prototype from what was initially just an idea.
- --> What a ride!!!
- And Thank you for viewing.
