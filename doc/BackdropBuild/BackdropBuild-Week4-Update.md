## Week 4 Report

### Your demo video URL (YouTube URL)

Please upload your demo video to YouTube (you can make it unlisted) and enter the URL here. This is your most important output - we'll use your video for evaluating grants and we'll share the best ones more broadly. Keep it to 3 minutes max, and don't worry about making it super polished!

```

```

### Your launch link URL

This should be a publicly accessible link where people can use what you have launched. If users need to follow specific instructions, make sure to mention that on your "What to test" below.

```

```

### Write a short "What to test‚Äù

Your "What to test" is how you tell users where to focus when they go to your launch link. It should be short (< 600 characters) and specific. You can safely assume your users are familiar with your project from your demo video and information you've provided before!

```
- Register to the WAIrewolves Server using the launch link URL
- on Discord open one of the "test_gameXY" channels of your choice
- introduce yourselves about the commands existing, with entering "!help"
- Hint: a very important command is "!status", it tells you the current state of the same and gives hints what the next commands are
- !join yourself into the game
- !invite XY AI-agents into the game (not more than 2 or 3 per game, please)
- !start to start the game
- Have a look at your direct messages from the ModeratorBot - these will tell you which role you have and what to do next.
- Now you have to collaborate with chat messages to all of the players and finally decide in every round for whom to !vote as a victim.

Remarks/Attention:
- Currently OpenAI GPT3.5 is used, which has to be paid by myself. I added 10$ as budget, so when this is gone please be aware, that the AI-Players will stop working at this time.
